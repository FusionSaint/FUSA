<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

With Battlefield 6 launching October 10, players are eager to know which classes (kits) and weapons will dominate the early meta. The game's **new open weapon system** lets any class use any weapon, so choosing the most effective guns is critical.

This guide breaks down meta predictions for both kits and weapons using the latest information from October 2025, including the best weapon in each category and an overall top pick.

</div>

<Callout variant="info">
The open weapon system means you'll often choose your class for its gadget/ability and pair it with the best weapon available for the situation.

## Class Meta Overview

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Even though you can mix and match weapons with any class, each kit still has unique gadgets and perks that impact its effectiveness. Early impressions indicate all four classes are viable, but some have clear strengths in the open-weapon environment.

</div>

### Assault

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Role: Frontline Attacker**

A frontline attacker equipped with breaching tools like grenade launchers and an Adrenaline Injector. Assault was very popular during the beta due to powerful close-range options (the M87A1 shotgun was part of its default kit) and explosive gadget combos.

**Launch Changes**
- Given more team-oriented gadgets (e.g., Spawn Beacon) to balance it out
- Great for aggressive objective play
- Best when armed with strong assault rifle or carbine

**Best For**
- Spearheading attacks
- Objective captures
- Aggressive close-to-mid range combat

</div>

### Engineer

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Role: Vehicle Destruction & Repair Expert**

Engineers carry launchers and the repair tool, making them indispensable on vehicle-heavy maps. Their class perk reduces explosive damage taken, so they excel at taking out tanks and fortifications.

**Strengths**
- Critical on vehicle-heavy maps
- Essential for team when armor is in play
- Explosive damage resistance

**Weaknesses**
- Less dominant in infantry-only fights
- Relies on having top-tier gun choice to compete in pure gunfights

</div>

### Support (Medic)

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Role: Combat Medic**

The Support class plays the classic medic role—fast revives, health and ammo supplies. In Battlefield 6's open weapon system, many players expect Support to be a powerhouse because you can take a great assault rifle while still providing healing and revives.

**Why It's Strong**
- No one revives or drags wounded teammates faster
- Can wield top-tier gun while keeping squads alive
- Extremely valuable for team sustainability
- Good Support players can carry games

**Meta Status**
- **Standout general-purpose pick**
- Combat medic with any gun combination
- Expected to be highly popular

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
Support stands out as a general-purpose pick—you get combat medic capabilities with any top-tier weapon. Expect this to be one of the most popular classes at launch.
</Callout>

### Recon

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Role: Intel & Long-Range Specialist**

Recon gets tools like motion sensor and even a UAV drone for spotting enemies. In the open beta, Recon proved very strong when used aggressively—equipping close or mid-range weapons (SMG or AR) and using sensor gadgets allowed players to sweep objectives with constant enemy intel.

**Playstyles**
- **Aggressive**: SMG/AR with motion sensors for objective play
- **Traditional**: Sniper rifle at range with auto-spotting perk
- **Intel Support**: UAV drone for team information advantage

**Best For**
- Sharp aim players
- Information gathering
- Smart positioning over brute force

</div>

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

**Bottom Line:** All classes have their place, but **Support** stands out as a general-purpose pick (combat medic with any gun) and **Assault** remains a strong choice for spearheading attacks. **Recon** can be a force-multiplier with its intel (especially in smaller modes), and **Engineer** is indispensable when vehicles are involved.

## Best Weapons by Category

</div>

#### L110

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

DMRs reward accuracy and precision, offering devastating power for players who can consistently land shots.

</div>

#### SVK-8.6

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Tier: S-Tier**

The consensus top DMR in Battlefield 6. This semi-automatic marksman rifle hits extremely hard—about **66 damage per shot**—meaning it can down an enemy with just two hits to the body.

**Stats**
- Damage: 66 per shot (2-shot kill)

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Sniper rifles reward precision and patience, capable of one-shot kills at extreme ranges when used correctly.

</div>

</div>

#### M87A1

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

### Sidearms

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Sidearms serve as reliable backup weapons when your primary runs dry, with the best ones prioritizing fire rate and magazine capacity.

</div>

#### P18 & ES 5.7

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

<div class="my-12 border-t-2 border-primary/30"></div>

## Best Overall Weapon

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Which weapon is the absolute best in Battlefield 6 right now? Considering versatility and power, the community consensus points to the **NVO-228E assault rifle** as the top overall gun at launch.

Multiple sources have noted that the NVO-228E "could easily be the best weapon in Battlefield 6" thanks to its combination of high damage, decent rate of fire, and manageable recoil.

</div>

### Why NVO-228E Dominates

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

**Very Few Weaknesses**
- Effective at various ranges
- Lethal in only a few shots
- Relatively easy to control
- Meta-defining choice for almost any kit or playstyle

**Versus Specialists**
- **M87A1 shotgun**: Annihilates in close quarters but usefulness drops off beyond short distances
- **AK-205 carbine**: Extremely accurate and versatile for mid-range duels
- **KV9 SMG**: Wins any point-blank spray battle
- These are role-specific stars; NVO-228E is consistent across most scenarios

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
Prepare to see a lot of NVO-228E assault rifles on the battlefield. This rifle, paired with a strong kit (Support or Assault), is expected to define the early meta.
</Callout>

### Meta Prediction

<div class="space-y-4 mb-10">

**Expected Loadouts**
- NVO-228E paired with Support for healing/revives
- NVO-228E paired with Assault for aggressive objective play
- High popularity across all skill levels

**Team Balance**
- Battlefield is about combined arms and team play
- Balanced squad using mix of weapon types always has edge
- Sniper, LMG, SMG/shotgun all have roles
- But for single best general-purpose gun: NVO-228E is the safe bet

</div>

<Callout variant="info">
A balanced squad using the other top-tier weapons (mix of sniper, LMG, SMG/shotgun where appropriate) will always have an edge. But if you're looking for the single best general-purpose gun to give your team an advantage on day one, the NVO-228E is a very safe bet.
