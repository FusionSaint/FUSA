<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

With Battlefield 6 launching October 10, players are eager to know which classes (kits) and weapons will dominate the early meta. The game's **new open weapon system** lets any class use any weapon, so choosing the most effective guns is critical.

This guide breaks down meta predictions for both kits and weapons using the latest information from October 2025, including the best weapon in each category and an overall top pick.

</div>

<Callout variant="info">
The open weapon system means you'll often choose your class for its gadget/ability and pair it with the best weapon available for the situation.

## <Users className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> Class Meta Overview

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Even though you can mix and match weapons with any class, each kit still has unique gadgets and perks that impact its effectiveness. Early impressions indicate all four classes are viable, but some have clear strengths in the open-weapon environment.

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

### <Swords className="inline-block mr-2 mb-1" size={24} /> Assault

**Role:** <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Frontline Attacker</span>

A frontline attacker equipped with breaching tools like grenade launchers and an Adrenaline Injector. Assault was very popular during the beta due to powerful close-range options and explosive gadget combos.

**Launch Changes**
- Given more team-oriented gadgets (e.g., Spawn Beacon)
- Great for aggressive objective play
- Best when armed with strong assault rifle or carbine

**Best For**
- Spearheading attacks
- Objective captures
- Aggressive close-to-mid range combat

</div>

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

### <Shield className="inline-block mr-2 mb-1" size={24} /> Engineer

**Role:** <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Vehicle Destruction & Repair Expert</span>

Engineers carry launchers and the repair tool, making them indispensable on vehicle-heavy maps. Their class perk reduces explosive damage taken.

**Strengths**
- Critical on vehicle-heavy maps
- Essential for team when armor is in play
- Explosive damage resistance

**Weaknesses**
- Less dominant in infantry-only fights
- Relies on having top-tier gun choice

</div>

### <Crosshair className="inline-block mr-2 mb-1" size={24} /> Support (Medic)

**Role:** <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Combat Medic</span>

The Support class plays the classic medic role—fast revives, health and ammo supplies. In Battlefield 6's open weapon system, many players expect Support to be a powerhouse.

**Why It's Strong**
- No one revives or drags wounded teammates faster
- Can wield top-tier gun while keeping squads alive
- Extremely valuable for team sustainability
- Good Support players can carry games

**Meta Status:** <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Standout general-purpose pick</span>

</div>

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

### <Target className="inline-block mr-2 mb-1" size={24} /> Recon

**Role:** <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Intel & Long-Range Specialist</span>

Recon gets tools like motion sensor and UAV drone for spotting enemies. Proved very strong when used aggressively in the beta.

**Playstyles**
- **Aggressive**: SMG/AR with motion sensors for objective play
- **Traditional**: Sniper rifle at range with auto-spotting perk
- **Intel Support**: UAV drone for team information advantage

**Best For**
- Sharp aim players
- Information gathering
- Smart positioning over brute force

</div>

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
Support stands out as a general-purpose pick—you get combat medic capabilities with any top-tier weapon. Expect this to be one of the most popular classes at launch.

SMGs dominate close-quarters combat with high fire rates and excellent mobility, perfect for aggressive objective play.

</div>

One of the top SMGs in BF6, the PW7A2 provides incredible versatility. It fires at <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">947 RPM</span> and has very low recoil, meaning it stays on target even when spraying.

**Best For**
- Tight quarters combat
- Raw time-to-kill dominance
- Classic "bullet hose" playstyle

## Best Overall Weapon

<div class="p-8 rounded-lg border-2 border-fs-gold/50 bg-card/30 mb-8">

### <Target className="inline-block mr-2 mb-1" size={28} /> NVO-228E: The Meta King

Which weapon is the absolute best in Battlefield 6 right now? Considering versatility and power, the community consensus points to the **NVO-228E assault rifle** as the top overall gun at launch.

Multiple sources have noted that the NVO-228E "could easily be the best weapon in Battlefield 6" thanks to its combination of high damage, decent rate of fire, and manageable recoil.

**Very Few Weaknesses**
- Effective at various ranges
- Lethal in only a few shots
- Relatively easy to control
- Meta-defining choice for almost any kit or playstyle

**Versus Specialists**
- **M87A1 shotgun**: Annihilates in close quarters but usefulness drops off beyond short distances
- **AK-205 carbine**: Extremely accurate and versatile for mid-range duels
- **KV9 SMG**: Wins any point-blank spray battle
- These are role-specific stars; NVO-228E is consistent across most scenarios

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
Prepare to see a lot of NVO-228E assault rifles on the battlefield. This rifle, paired with a strong kit (Support or Assault), is expected to define the early meta.
</Callout>

### Meta Prediction

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-10">

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

**Expected Loadouts**
- NVO-228E paired with <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Support</span> for healing/revives
- NVO-228E paired with <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Assault</span> for aggressive objective play
- High popularity across all skill levels

</div>

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

**Team Balance**
- Battlefield is about combined arms and team play
- Balanced squad using mix of weapon types always has edge
- Sniper, LMG, SMG/shotgun all have roles
- But for single best general-purpose gun: <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">NVO-228E</span> is the safe bet

</div>

</div>

<Callout variant="info">
A balanced squad using the other top-tier weapons (mix of sniper, LMG, SMG/shotgun where appropriate) will always have an edge. But if you're looking for the single best general-purpose gun to give your team an advantage on day one, the NVO-228E is a very safe bet.
