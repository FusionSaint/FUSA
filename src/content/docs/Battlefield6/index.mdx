## Quick Start Recommendations

<div class="space-y-6 mb-10">

**New to Battlefield 6?** Start here for the fastest route to competitive readiness:

1. **Configure Your Settings** - Begin with the [Competitive Settings](/battlefield6/settings) guide to optimize your PC for maximum performance and responsiveness. Dial in your sensitivity, FOV, and audio before you even launch your first match.

2. **Learn the Meta** - Review the [Launch Meta](/battlefield6/meta-loadouts) guide to understand which classes and weapons are strongest. Pick a loadout that fits your playstyle and start with a meta weapon like the NVO-228E assault rifle.

3. **Understand What Changed** - If you played the beta, read the [Patch Notes](/battlefield6/patch-notes) to see what's different. Movement is less twitchy, gunplay is more grounded, and over 200 bugs have been fixed.

<Callout variant="tip">
Beta veterans: The game feels significantly different at launch. Movement nerfs, weapon rebalancing, and netcode improvements mean you'll need to adjust your playstyle. Read the patch notes to stay ahead.
