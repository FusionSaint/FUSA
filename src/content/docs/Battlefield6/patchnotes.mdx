## <User className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> Movement & Player Mechanics

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Movement has been significantly rebalanced to be less "twitchy" and more grounded, rewarding positioning over exploitation of movement mechanics.

</div>

### Slide/Jump Nerfs

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-8">

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30">

**Momentum Reduction**

- Speed and momentum from sliding into a jump **greatly reduced**
- Prevents extreme slide-jump chaining seen in beta

## Final Notes

<div class="space-y-6 mb-10">

Battlefield 6 at launch will feel noticeably different from the beta. Movement is more controlled, gunplay is tighter, and over 200 bugs and glitches have been fixed across the board.

PC players using mouse & keyboard should enjoy the new settings options and better performance optimization. Re-familiarize yourself with updated recoil patterns and the slower movement pace—it's a deliberate change to make the game more tactical and in line with classic Battlefield style.

With these launch patch changes, coordinate with the new spawn/beacon rules, dial in your settings, and prepare for a refined Battlefield experience.

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
Good luck and have fun out there with Battlefield 6's refined launch experience!
