## What You'll Find Here

Each game section contains detailed resources created for tactical players:
- **Game Landing Page** An overview of each guide letting you know what you will find inside.  
- **Meta Loadouts:** Current weapon and gear recommendations tuned for performance and balance patches.  
- **Squad Compositions:** Proven team setups for specific mission types or objectives.  
- **Patch Notes & Updates:** Summaries and analyses of major balance changes as they happen.  
- **In-Depth Strategies:** Expert insights to help your squad operate like a coordinated unit.  
- **Resources & Farming Guides:** Efficient paths for medals, credits, warbonds, and unlockables.

<Callout variant="info">
FusionSaint Guides is constantly evolving. Every update, patch, or meta shift will eventually be reflected across the site — ensuring your knowledge stays fresh. We plan on implementing a feature, in the future, to note which patch each game is on so you can be sure you have the most up to date information.

## Navigating the Site

Use the **sidebar** on the left to explore:
- Each **game title** (e.g. *Helldivers 2*, *Battlefield 6*, *Dune: Spice Wars*, *Warzone*)  
- Individual **guide categories** inside each game — such as *Loadouts*, *Missions*, *Patch Notes*, *Tips & Tricks*, and more.  
- The **search bar** at the top to instantly find specific weapons, tactics, or keywords.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you're new here, start with your main game — each section has an **"Overview"** or **"Core Meta"** guide designed to get you fully mission-ready in minutes.
</Callout>
<Callout variant="danger">
FusionSaint Guides are designed to help you be the best you can be within the parameters of the game. You will not find any cheats, hacks, or exploits on the page. If that is what you are looking for, you will need to look elsewhere.

## The Vision Behind FusionSaint

**FusionSaint Guides** started as a project to unify everything my friends and I learned from years of competitive and cooperative gaming — all in one accessible, beautifully organized space. As we got new friends to join us in whatever we were playing at the time, we realized it was hard to get people up to speed and sometimes even harder to keep up to date. So, I started creating mini-websites to house the information but having to constantly manually update each site became a chore of its own. So, a new project was born!

**The goal:**
<div class="text-secondary">
> To transform raw patch notes, forum data, and hours of trial-and-error into clean, structured knowledge anyone can use.
</div>

Every page reflects that philosophy — clarity, precision, and tactical focus.

We build **for players, by players** — so if you find something useful, share it with your squad.
