**The Soviet Union leverages numerical superiority, versatile conscripts, and devastating late-game armor.** Soviet doctrines range from defensive fortification to overwhelming assault, offering unmatched artillery options and the most feared heavy tanks in the game. From cost-effective infantry swarms to elite special forces, the Red Army provides diverse strategic approaches built around mass, momentum, and firepower.

Whether you're burying enemies under Katyusha rockets, rolling IS-2 heavy tanks, or infiltrating with elite commandos, the Soviet Union offers six distinct doctrines—each emphasizing different aspects of overwhelming force.

</div>

<Callout variant="tip">
**Soviet Strengths:** Cost-effective infantry masses, most heavy armor options (IS-2, ISU-152, KV-series), powerful rocket artillery, and doctrines spanning defensive to ultra-aggressive playstyles.
