**British Forces excel at holding ground with superior defensive emplacements and devastating artillery.** UK doctrines emphasize positional warfare, infantry sections with powerful upgrades, and the ability to punish aggressive opponents. From Commonwealth defensive lines to Churchill heavy armor breakthroughs, British commanders control the battlefield through methodical advances backed by overwhelming firepower.

Whether you're locking down sectors with artillery emplacements, dropping elite paratroopers behind enemy lines, or grinding forward with Churchill tanks, the British offer six distinct doctrines—each emphasizing discipline, firepower, and tactical control.
