**The Waffen-SS features the game's most elite infantry and specialized tactical options.** SS doctrines emphasize quality over quantity with powerful specialist units, aggressive tactics, and unique abilities unavailable to other factions. From cheap cost-efficient infantry to devastating heavy armor, the SS offers tactical flexibility through superior unit quality and specialized combined arms.

Whether you're fielding cheap Volkssturm militia with one-shot AT ambushes, deploying elite Jäger specialists with vision dominance, or rolling Panthers and Tigers, the Waffen-SS provides six distinct doctrines—each offering unique tactical approaches built around elite forces and aggressive play.

## Panzerjäger Tactics

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

**Versatile combined arms with air superiority.** Blend AI Shermans and AT StuGs with cheap elite infantry, then cap it with the fearsome Jagdtiger super-heavy tank destroyer.

</div>

### Specialty Units & Signature Tools

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30 mb-6">

**Cheap SS Infantry** — <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">~240 MP cost</span> but outperform peer units in combat effectiveness

</div>

<div class="my-12 border-t-2 border-primary/30"></div>

## Propaganda Tactics

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

**Volkssturm militia with limited ultra-elites.** The only SS doctrine with real manpower economy—swarm with Volkssturm, anchor with irreplaceable veterans, and threaten armor with one-shot AT ambushes.

</div>

### Specialty Units & Signature Tools

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30 mb-6">
