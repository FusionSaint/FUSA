## How to Use This Tool

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

The doctrine comparison tool serves multiple strategic purposes. Here's how to get the most value from it:

</div>

### Finding Your Playstyle Match

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card/50 mb-6">

**1. Identify your preferred capabilities**

Think about your natural playstyle:
- Do you prefer overwhelming firepower? → Look for high Artillery + Defense
- Do you like aggressive armor pushes? → Seek high Heavy Armor + Mobility
- Do you excel at elite micro? → Find high Elite Infantry + Mobility
- Do you prefer defensive play? → Look for high Defense + Anti-Tank

**2. Select doctrines that match**

Use the faction dropdown to explore options, then select doctrines one at a time to see their radar signature. Doctrines with strong ratings in your preferred areas are natural fits.

**3. Test and refine**

Compare similar doctrines to find subtle differences. For example, USA Armored vs Wehrmacht Panzer both have high Heavy Armor but differ significantly in other areas.

</div>

### Analyzing Matchups

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card/50 mb-6">

**Enable comparison mode to overlay opponent doctrines**

1. Check the "Enable Comparison Mode" box
2. Select your doctrine first
3. Add opponent's doctrine to overlay
4. Look for areas where they're weak and you're strong

**Example:** If your opponent is Wehrmacht Ost (high Defense, low Mobility), your USA Mechanized (high Mobility) can exploit their inability to respond quickly to flanks.

**Counter-Strategy Matrix:**
- High Artillery doctrines → Counter with Mobility to avoid barrages
- High Heavy Armor → Counter with Anti-Tank specialists
- High Elite Infantry → Counter with Artillery or Heavy Armor
- High Mobility → Counter with Defense and static AT

</div>

### Team Game Coordination

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card/50 mb-6">

**Compare allied doctrines to ensure coverage**

In team games, complementary doctrines create unstoppable combinations:

**Perfect Pairs:**
- **Artillery + Heavy Armor** → Soften defenses, then breakthrough with tanks
- **Anti-Tank + Elite Infantry** → Deny enemy armor, dominate infantry fights
- **Mobility + Defense** → Fast player flanks while defensive player holds center
- **Air Power + Heavy Armor** → Recon reveals targets, armor capitalizes

**Example Team Composition:**
- Player 1: USSR Artilleriyskaya (Artillery/Defense)
- Player 2: USA Armored (Heavy Armor/AT)
- **Result:** Player 1 breaks fortifications with artillery, Player 2 exploits with armor

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
**Pro Tip:** In 2v2 or larger team games, coordinate doctrine selection before the match. Ensure your team has strong coverage across all seven dimensions rather than duplicating capabilities.

## Strategic Insights

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

### Identifying Power Spikes

Each doctrine has timing windows where it excels:

</div>

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card/50 mb-8">

**Early Game Dominance** (0-10 minutes)
- High Elite Infantry doctrines (Airborne, Fallschirmjäger, Rangers)
- High Mobility doctrines (Leichte, Mechanized)
- Goal: Secure map control before opponents scale

**Mid Game Transitions** (10-20 minutes)
- Balanced doctrines hit their stride
- Medium armor becomes available
- Anti-Tank doctrines begin to shine

**Late Game Dominance** (20+ minutes)
- High Heavy Armor doctrines (Panzer, Tankovaya, Armored)
- Artillery Fortress doctrines become impenetrable
- Tank Destroyer doctrines counter enemy heavies

</div>

### Recognizing Weaknesses

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card/50 mb-8">

**Low Artillery Doctrines**

Struggle to break fortified positions. Vulnerable to defensive camping. Must win through maneuver.

**Exploit:** Dig in with bunkers and emplacements. Force them to attack into prepared positions.

**Low Anti-Tank Doctrines**

Cannot handle enemy armor concentrations. Must avoid tank battles or rely on allies.

**Exploit:** Build medium/heavy armor. Pressure their weak AT with tank pushes.

**Low Mobility Doctrines**

Cannot respond quickly to threats. Vulnerable to flanking and hit-and-run tactics.

**Exploit:** Use fast units to backcap and force them to split forces. Avoid frontal assaults.

**Low Defense Doctrines**

Cannot hold territory against sustained pressure. Must stay aggressive to prevent enemy fortification.

**Exploit:** Build defensive positions. Make them attack into your emplacements and AT guns.

</div>

<Callout variant="warning">
**Critical Rule:** Every doctrine has weaknesses. Use this tool to identify them in opponents, and compensate for your own through smart play or team coordination.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

### Can I compare doctrines from different factions?

**Yes!** Comparison mode works across factions. This is especially useful for:
- Understanding what you'll face as an opponent
- Planning team game compositions
- Learning matchup advantages and disadvantages

### How many doctrines can I compare at once?

**Up to 3 doctrines** can be compared simultaneously. More than 3 makes the radar chart hard to read. For more extensive comparisons, compare in groups of 2-3, then switch to different combinations.

### Are these ratings official?

**No, these are analytical ratings** based on doctrine capabilities and competitive play patterns. Values represent relative strength in each dimension compared to all other doctrines.

### Why doesn't my favorite doctrine show up stronger?

Remember that **higher isn't always better**. A doctrine with lower overall ratings might be exactly what your playstyle needs, or it might excel in specific matchups. The tool shows capabilities, not overall power.

### How often are these ratings updated?

Ratings may be adjusted based on game balance patches, meta shifts, or community feedback. Check the page periodically for updates.
