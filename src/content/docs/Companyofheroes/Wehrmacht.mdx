**The Wehrmacht combines tactical flexibility with devastating firepower.** German doctrines emphasize defensive superiority, elite infantry options, and the most feared anti-tank capabilities in the game. From fortified positions to mobile warfare, Wehrmacht commanders can adapt to any battlefield situation while leveraging superior combined arms coordination.

Whether you're building impenetrable defensive lines, fielding elite paratroopers, or rolling forward with Tiger tanks, the Wehrmacht offers six distinct strategic approaches—each with its own tactical identity and win condition.

## Ost-Division (Eastern Static Defense)

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

**Ultimate defensive fortress doctrine.** Dig in with layered fortifications and long-range AT, trading space for time while bleeding attackers dry through attrition.

</div>

### Specialty Units & Signature Tools

<div class="p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary/20 bg-card/30 mb-6">

**Osttruppen** — <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Cheap utility infantry</span> excel at building, repairing, and operating weapon emplacements

**Extra Defenses** — <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Bunkers, obstacles, static weapons</span> create layered defensive positions that bleed attackers

**Ferdinand Heavy Tank Destroyer** — <span class="text-fs-gold font-semibold">Extreme range AT</span> punishes armor from impossible distances

</div>

### Strategic Summary

<div class="space-y-4 mb-6">

Ost-Division excels at creating impenetrable defensive positions that force enemies to overextend. Build layered fortifications with cheap Osttruppen utility troops, then punish attackers with long-range AT defenses anchored by the fearsome Ferdinand. Trade space for time early, then counter-attack when enemies exhaust themselves against your fortifications.
