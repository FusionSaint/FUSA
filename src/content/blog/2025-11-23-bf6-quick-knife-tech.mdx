<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

**Since launch, PC players have been asking for a dedicated melee equip key.** The old "Hold to Knife" system was clunky, inconsistent, and often left you slashing air when you meant to interact with a door.

**Patch 1.1.2.0 finally delivered.** Hidden in the keybinds menu is a new option: **"Equip Melee Weapon"**.

It sounds like a minor quality-of-life change, but for competitive players, it unlocks a new tier of movement tech and CQC lethality. Here is why you need to rebind it immediately.

</div>

<div class="my-12 border-t-2 border-primary/30"></div>

## <Keyboard className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> The Setup: Unbinding "Hold to Melee"

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

The default interaction key (usually F or E) is overloaded. It opens doors, revives teammates, picks up weapons, *and* pulls out your knife if you hold it. This "hold" delay (approx. 300ms) is an eternity in a close-range fight.

**The Fix:**
1.  Go to **Options > Key Bindings > On Foot**.
2.  Find **"Equip Melee Weapon"** (it is likely unbound or set to a number key).
3.  Bind it to an easily accessible key.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Mouse 4** or **Mouse 5** (Thumb buttons).
    *   **Alternative:** **V** or **C** (Thumb/Index access).

</div>

<Callout variant="warning">
**Pro Tip:** Do not unbind your standard "Melee Attack" (Quick Melee) key. You still need that for panic situations. This new bind is specifically for *equipping* the knife to run faster or prep a specific move.
</Callout>

## <Zap className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> The Tech: Why It's Faster

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Why bother equipping the knife instead of just pressing the quick-melee button? **Animation priority.**

When you use "Quick Melee," your character has to:
1.  Lower weapon.
2.  Raise knife.
3.  Slash.
4.  Raise weapon again.

When you **Equip Melee**, you bypass the "Lower Weapon" recovery frames if you time it right, and you can sprint instantly with the knife out.

### 1. Instant Window Breach

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="p-6 bg-card/50 rounded-lg border border-border">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mb-3">The Old Way</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-foreground/80">
      Sprint at window → Press Melee → Wait for animation → Glass breaks → Vault.
    </p>
    <div class="text-xs text-red-400 mt-2 font-semibold">Result: Momentum lost.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="p-6 bg-primary/10 rounded-lg border border-primary/20">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mb-3">The Quick-Knife Way</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-foreground/80">
      Sprint → Tap Equip Melee (Mouse 4) → Left Click (Slash) → Vault.
    </p>
    <div class="text-xs text-green-400 mt-2 font-semibold">Result: Zero momentum loss. You flow through the glass.</div>
  </div>
</div>

### 2. The "Shoot-Slash" Combo

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

In CQC, if you run out of ammo or an enemy is one-shot, the "Shoot-Slash" combo is the fastest TTK finisher in the game.

*   **Mechanic:** Fire your last bullet → Immediately tap Equip Melee → Left Click.
*   **Why it works:** The "Equip" action cancels the firing recoil animation of your gun instantly.
*   **Damage:** 50 (Knife) + whatever bullet damage you landed.

</div>

### 3. The "Lightweight" Sprint

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

It is a classic Battlefield mechanic, but it is often forgotten: **you run faster with your knife out.**

*   **The Data:** Sprinting with a primary weapon caps at approx. **6.05 m/s**. Sprinting with a knife (or repair tool/defib) hits **7.15 m/s**.
*   **The Advantage:** That ~18% speed boost is the difference between making it to cover and getting sniped.
*   **Execution:** Tap Equip Melee → Sprint across the open street → Equip Primary before you enter the next building.

</div>

### 4. Vehicle Exit Readiness

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

Patch 1.1.2.0 fixed the "ghost bullet" bug when exiting vehicles, but there is still a delay before your primary weapon is ready to fire.

*   **The Trick:** If you are bailing from a doomed vehicle in CQC, tap your **Equip Melee** bind as you exit.
*   **Why:** The knife equip animation is faster than the primary weapon "ready" animation. You can slash a nearby enemy (like the C4 runner who blew you up) faster than you can shoot them.

## <Skull className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> The 5-Minute Drill

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

It takes time to break the muscle memory of "Holding F". Hop into a Portal Sandbox or an empty server and do this:

1.  **Window Run:** Find a building with multiple windows. Sprint through them, equipping your knife *before* you hit the glass. Try to vault without stopping.
2.  **Swap Speed:** Practice shooting one bullet, then instantly swapping to knife and slashing. Do this until it feels like one fluid motion.
3.  **Ladder Drop:** Jump off a ladder, equip knife in mid-air (cancels the "heavy landing" animation if timed with a slide), and keep running.

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
**Final Verdict:** The "Equip Melee" bind is a small setting with a massive skill ceiling impact. It makes your movement more fluid, your breaches faster, and your CQC finishers instant. **Bind it today.**
