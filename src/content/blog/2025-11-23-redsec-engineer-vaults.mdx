**RNG is the enemy of consistency.** In RedSec, most squads land, loot random buildings, and pray for a Rare (Blue) gun. If they are lucky, they find one. If not, they get wiped by the first team they meet.

**Smart squads don't pray. They play Engineer.**

The Engineer's **Repair Tool** isn't just for fixing tanks—it is a skeleton key for the high-security vaults scattered across Fort Lyndon. These vaults are the *only* guaranteed source of S-Tier (Legendary) loot in the early game.

Here is the route that will get your entire squad fully kitted in under 5 minutes. We call it **"The Industrial Loop."**

## <Map className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> The Route: The Industrial Loop

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

This route focuses on the eastern industrial sector. It is less contested than Downtown but rich in vault locations.

</div>

### Step 1: Drop Chemical Storage (Vault A)

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="p-6 bg-card/50 rounded-lg border border-border">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mb-3">The Drop</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-foreground/80">
      Land directly on the main processing plant (the largest building with the smokestacks). The vault is in the basement level, accessible via the north ramp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p-6 bg-primary/10 rounded-lg border border-primary/20">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mb-3">The Loot</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-foreground/80">
      Usually contains 2 Legendary Weapons and Level 3 Armor.
    </p>
    <div class="text-xs text-green-400 mt-2 font-semibold">Goal: Gear up your Entry Fragger (Assault) immediately.</div>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Rotate to Lyndon Oilworks (Vault B)

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

Grab a vehicle from the Chemical parking lot and drive south. The Oilworks vault is located in the central office building (look for the security camera icon on the wall).

*   **Threat Check:** This is a B-Tier POI, so you might bump into one other squad. Use your superior gear from Vault A to wipe them.
*   **The Prize:** More weapons and, crucially, **Vehicle Keycards**.

</div>

### Step 3: End at Redline Storage (Vault C)

<div class="space-y-4 mb-8">

Finish the loop at the warehouses. The vault here is often overlooked because it's tucked behind the shipping containers in Warehouse 4.

*   **The Payoff:** By this point, you should have 3-4 Legendary weapons and full armor for the squad. You are now ready to hunt High Value Assets (HVAs) while the rest of the lobby is still scraping for loot.

</div>

## <Lock className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> The Mechanics: How to Open Vaults

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Many new Engineers don't realize how the mechanic works and get shot while fumbling with the door.

1.  **Equip Repair Tool:** Press `3` (default) to pull it out.
2.  **Hold Left Click:** You must burn through the three locking bolts.
3.  **Don't Stop:** If you stop burning, the bolts cool down and re-lock.
4.  **Time:** It takes approximately **8 seconds** to open a vault.

</div>

<Callout variant="warning">
**The Noise:** Cutting the bolts is LOUD. It sounds like an industrial grinder and can be heard from 50m away. You are announcing your position.
</Callout>

<div class="my-12 border-t-2 border-primary/30"></div>

## <Shield className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> Squad Protocol: Protect the Key

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

The Engineer is vulnerable while cutting. Do not let them do it alone.

*   **Assault:** Hold the door/corridor. You are the first line of defense if a team pushes the noise.
*   **Recon:** Place a Motion Sensor outside the building *before* the cutting starts.
*   **Support:** Drop ammo on the Engineer. They might need it immediately after the door opens if there's a fight.

## <Users className="inline-block mr-3 mb-1" size={32} /> Loot Distribution Priority

<div class="space-y-6 mb-8">

Don't be a loot goblin. Distribute the Legendary gear to maximize squad efficiency.

1.  **Legendary ARs/SMGs:** Go to your **Assault** and **Engineer**. They are your fraggers.
2.  **Legendary Snipers:** Go to **Recon** (obviously).
3.  **Level 3 Armor:** Priority to the **Support** (the Anchor). If they die, the squad wipes. If the Assault dies, the Support can revive them.
4.  **Vehicle Keycards:** Give these to the **Engineer**. They are the driver/repair specialist.

</div>

<Callout variant="success">
**Final Tip:** If you find a "Gold Bar" item in a vault, do NOT sell it at a buy station. It is a crafting component for the secret "Midas" weapon skin. Extract with it!
